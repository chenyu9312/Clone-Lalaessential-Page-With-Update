						The Skin is regarded as the largest organ of the body. Therefore, we must be conscious of what we expose 
						to our skin as it absorbs substances faster than we are able to digest. We should also prioritize 
						skin care and question our daily regimes of use of commercial products which contain harmful toxins. 
						Did you know that the average adult is exposed to 168 hazardous chemicals each day? 
					</p>
				
					<p class="double_spaced">
						Organic skin 
						care products provide the only safe alternative to divert from exposing your body to these harms. 
						Organic ingredients are better suited for sensitive skin and do not act as irritant, thus preventing 
						the creation of skin conditions and development of allergies. Also, organic skin care products  
						help to illuminate vitality, health and a youthful skin texture while maintaining immunity, as 
						toxic solvents strip skin of the ability protect against bacteria, illness and infection.
